# MachineLearning
This repository will contain the assignments I did as a part of the Machine Learning A-Z course which I aced due to code readability and simplicity.

My best work in this repo - recommendation.ipynb (apparel recommendation) path:MLDLwizard/MachineLearning/My_codes/recommendation.ipynb

Also checkout the knn_mnist.ipynb where instead of using sklearn, i performed the prediction from scratch using knn
